“Your Temporary Ride” web app
I made it fully using python, HTML, SQL and JavaScript languages
The app has some simple security features as it’s non-vulnerable to 
SQL Injection attack.
The app has a lot of feature which makes the user that is using it 
Have full control over his Fleet and Customers.
It can:
1.	Add/remove cars
2.	Add/remove customers
3.	Set car status accordingly (Active/out of service/reserved)
4.	Change cars’ prices 
5.	Full record of every reservation (past and present)
6.	Modify customers’ info.
7.	Rent Cars of course
8.	Calculate price using Real time
9.	Minimum charge is only a day’s price (even if the car is used for a few hours)
10.	Easy GUI
To run the app locally
1. create a folder and add app.py and init_db.py files in it + two folders for templates and static
2. run th app.py in visual studio do the same to init_db.py (this is done once)
3. type in your browser 127.0.0.1:5000
